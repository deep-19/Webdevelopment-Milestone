        <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
            <li>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October 1931 to a Tamil Muslim family in the pilgrimage centre of Rameswaram on Pamban Island, 
                then in the Madras Presidency and now in the State of Tamil Nadu. </li>
            <li>Kalam was the youngest of four brothers and one sister in his family.As a young boy he had to sell newspapers in order to add to the familyâ€™s meager income.</li>
            <li>In his school years, Kalam had average grades but was described as a bright and hardworking student who had a strong desire to learn. He spent hours on his studies, especially mathematics.</li>
            <li>He moved to Madras in 1955 to study aerospace engineering in Madras Institute of Technology.[13] While Kalam was working on a senior class project, the Dean was dissatisfied with his lack of progress and threatened to revoke his scholarship unless the project was finished within the next three days. Kalam met the deadline, impressing the Dean, who later said to him, "I was putting you under stress and asking you to meet a difficult deadline".
                 He narrowly missed achieving his dream of becoming a fighter pilot, as he placed ninth in qualifiers,
                  and only eight positions were available in the IAF.</li>
            <li>
                In 1960, Kalam joined the Aeronautical Development Establishment of the Defence Research and Development Organisation as a scientist after becoming a member of the Defence Research & Development Service (DRDS).
            </li>
            <li>
                In 1969, Kalam was transferred to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) where he was the project director of India's first Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III) which successfully deployed the Rohini satellite in near-earth orbit in July 1980; 
                Kalam had first started work on an expandable rocket project independently at DRDO in 1965.
            </li>
            <li>In 1998, along with cardiologist Soma Raju, Kalam developed a low cost coronary stent, named the "Kalam-Raju Stent".
                In 2012, the duo designed a rugged tablet computer for health care in rural areas, which was named the "Kalam-Raju Tablet".</li>
            <li>Kalam served as the 11th president of India, succeeding K. R. Narayanan.His term lasted from 25 July 2002 to 25 July 2007.</li>
            <li>Kalam was the third President of India to have been honoured with a Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honour, he was also the first scientist and the first bachelor to occupy Rashtrapati Bhawan.</li>
            <li>During his term as president, he was affectionately known as the People's President.</li>
            <li>After leaving office, Kalam became a visiting professor at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong,
                 the Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad, and the Indian Institute of Management Indore; an honorary fellow of Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore;[78] chancellor of the Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology Thiruvananthapuram; professor of Aerospace Engineering at Anna University; and an adjunct at many other academic and research institutions across India. He taught information technology at the International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad, and technology at Banaras Hindu University and Anna University.</li>
            <li>In May 2012, Kalam launched a programme for the youth of India called the What Can I Give Movement, with a central theme of defeating corruption.</li>
            <li>On 27 July 2015, Kalam travelled to Shillong to deliver a lecture on "Creating a Livable Planet Earth" at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong. He collapsed in auditorium within 5 minutes of his lectures and after that when admitted in hospital he was declared dead due to cardiac arrest.
                On 30 July 2015, the former president was laid to rest at Rameswaram's Pei Karumbu Ground with full state honours.
            </li>
            <li>His last words, to his aide Srijan Pal Singh, were reportedly: "Funny guy! Are you doing well?"</li>
            <li>
                Kalam was noted for his integrity and his simple lifestyle. He never owned a television, and was in the habit of rising at 6:30 or 7 a.m. and sleeping by 2 a.m. His few personal possessions included his books, his veena, some articles of clothing, a CD player and a laptop; at his death, he left no will, and his possessions went to his eldest brother, who survived him.
            </li>
            <li>Religion and spirituality were very important to Kalam throughout his life.In fact, he made his own spiritual journey the subject of his final book, Transcendence: My Spiritual Experiences with Pramukh Swamiji.</li>
            <li> since Kalam believed that "respect for other faiths" was one of the key cornerstones of Islam, he was fond of saying: "For great men, religion is a way of making friends; small people make religion a fighting tool."</li>
            <li>In his book India 2020, Kalam strongly advocated an action plan to develop India into a "knowledge superpower" and a developed nation by the year 2020. </li>
            <li>Kalam took an active interest in other developments in the field of science and technology, including a research programme for developing biomedical implants. He also supported open source technology over proprietary software, predicting that the use of free software on a large scale would bring the benefits of information technology to more people.</li>
            <li>Kalam set a target of interacting with 100,000 students during the two years after his resignation from the post of scientific adviser in 1999.
                 He explained, "I feel comfortable in the company of young people, particularly high school students. 
                 Henceforth, I intend to share with them experiences, helping them to ignite their imagination and preparing them to work for a developed India for which the road map is already available."
                  His dream is to let every student to light up the sky with victory using their latent fire in the heart.</li>
            <li>
                The Government of India honoured him with the Padma Bhushan in 1981 and the Padma Vibhushan in 1990 for his work with ISRO and DRDO and his role as a scientific advisor to the Government. In 1997, Kalam received India's highest civilian honour, the Bharat Ratna, for his contribution to the scientific research and modernisation of defence technology in India. In 2013, he was the recipient of the Von Braun Award from the National Space Society "to recognize excellence in the management and leadership of a space-related project".
